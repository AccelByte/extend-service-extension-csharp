# 1. Introduction

We'll be exploring game backend development, focusing on building a custom service called Guild Service using gRPC, gRPC-Gateway, and AccelByte Gaming Service (AGS).

## 1.1 Purpose of This Guide

This guide serves to:

- Provide a practical walkthrough for developers on creating a custom backend service for a game, using a Guild Service as our relevant example.

- Demonstrate how to leverage powerful technologies like gRPC, gRPC-Gateway, and AccelByte's CloudSave service.

- Leverage AGS Extend Service Extension for seamless development to deployment

## 1.2 What You Will Achieve

By the end of this guide, you will:

- Understand the core concepts and operations of a Guild Service.
- Build a new endpoint and write service implementations.
- Test your service implementations and troubleshoot common issues.
